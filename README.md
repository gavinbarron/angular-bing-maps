##Project Status
This is a project that Credera is developing as part of a client engagement. All requirements / features of Angular Bing Maps are driven by that client's needs. Once our client's needs have been met, we will be focusing on any additional features requested by the community. In the meantime, please feel free to submit an issue and/or PR with any features that might be missing.
